# Fast-Food-Analysis
In this project, our team created a program to optimize fast-food restuarant expansion, intended as a proof of concept. We utilized PySpark to analyze fast-food competitors in each county & city in the United States, measured population and population density, and outputted the cities and counties with a low amount of fast-food competitors per capita. This analysis was supplemented by sentiment analysis that was pulled in real time from Twitter. Our team focused in on five California Cities in this proof of concept. 

Coding team consists of Michael Harris and Dave Arno.
